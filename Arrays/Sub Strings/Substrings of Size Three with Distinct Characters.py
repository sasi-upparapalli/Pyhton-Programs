# A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

# Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

# Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "xyzzaz"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
# The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aababcabc"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
# The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".



s = "xyzzaz"
c=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i,len(s)):
        temp=[]
        for k in range(i,j+1):
            temp.append(s[k])
        if len(temp)==3 and len(set(temp))==3:
            c=c+1
print(c)
